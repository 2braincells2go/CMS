Purpose of this community is to provide support for Instant Update CMS. We often share free stuff so keep up.

**Instant Update is free Open Source PHP/MySQL Content Management System (CMS).** 

The Difference from others
--------------

Instant Update is not based on any templates. **Your HTML is your template.** 

As HTML elements may have unique ID attribute set, our choice was to use HTML IDs to mark editable regions. This is all done on the fly. That means that Instant Update recognizes all IDs automatically.
